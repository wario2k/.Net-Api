# A Simple REST API created using C# .Net 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
### Summary:
This project is a simple restful service that allows the user to create, update, read and delete records from a DB. 
###
The ReportController handles all interactions with the DB and the Data Transfer Objects are being used to interact with the DB. 
All **CRUD** operations are currently supported and the Api was testing using a MSQL Database. 
### 
This should serve as a good template for anyone trying to build a simple REST Api and can be integrated as needed :smiley:.
